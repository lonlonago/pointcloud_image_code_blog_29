#  Principle 

>  The PCL :: correspondences class has two members, query and match, which are the indexes of the corresponding point pairs on the source and target point clouds respectively. You can access the corresponding points in the source through source [query]; source [query] .x, source [query] .y, source [query] .z to access the x, y, z coordinates of the corresponding points of the source in the matching point pair.
