#  I. Introduction 

##  1. Overview 

    PCL pcl :: Point XYZ RGB is used to store xyz coordinates and RGB information data structure, PCL pcl :: Point XYZ RGB structure is:

  ```  
    For historical reasons (PCL was originally developed as a ROS package) RGB information is stored as an integer and converted to a floating-point number. RGB information in LAS files is stored as uint16_t, as follows: 

  ```python

  ```  
    Therefore, to obtain RGB information from the LAS file using PCL, a corresponding data type conversion is required. 

##  2. Conversion method 

 You can use the following code snippet to package and decompress RGB colors into a PointXYZRGB structure:
