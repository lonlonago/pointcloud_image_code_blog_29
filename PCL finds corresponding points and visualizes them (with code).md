    PCL :: registration :: CorrespondenceEstimation is the base class to determine the correspondence between the target and the query point set (or feature). The input is the target and source point clouds, and the output is the point pair, which not only outputs the corresponding point set between the two sets of point clouds. Its inheritance relationship is shown in the figure.
