    The GPS time in the LAS file is a time tag value of type double for observing the point. The global coding low is cleared to GPS weekly time and set to GPS adjusted standard time. For aggregate model systems, the GPS time should be set to zero unless it is allocated from component measurements. The description of the official file is as follows: There is no point type in the PCL to save the GPS time, so a custom point type is required. For the method of customizing the point type, see: The PCL adds a custom point type.
